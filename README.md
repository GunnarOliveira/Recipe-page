# Recipe Page Challenge 🍲

Welcome to the Recipe Page Challenge! This repository contains a solution for the Frontend Mentor challenge, where I built a recipe page using only HTML and CSS. The project demonstrates responsiveness and the application of various design concepts.

## Project Structure 📂

  - **`styles/`**: Includes the main CSS file for styling the page.
  - **`images/`**: Houses the favicon and the main banner image used in the HTML document.
  - **`fonts/`**: Contains files needed to import the Outfit and Young-Serif fonts locally.

- **`design/`**: Holds preview images of the mobile and desktop layouts, which served as references during development.

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file for the recipe page.

- **`preview.png`**: A preview image of the project layout for quick reference on GitHub.

- **`style-guide.md`**: Provides the style guides and design principles used to aid in the coding process.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
